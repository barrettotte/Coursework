In the manufacture of the cam, a uniform solid cylinder of radius $R$ is first machined. Then an off-center hole of radius $R/2$ is drilled, parallel to the axis of the cylinder, and centered at a point a distance $R/2$ from the cneter of the cylinder. The cam,  of mass $M$, is then slipped onto the circular shaft and welded into place.
