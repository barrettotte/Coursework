The antenna is located far enough from the ground that reflections do not signicantly affect its radiation pattern. Most AM radio stations, however, use a Marconi antenna, which consists of the top half of a Hertz antenna. The lower end of this (quarter-wave) antenna is connected to Earth ground, and the ground itself serves as the missing lower half.
