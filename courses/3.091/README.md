# Introduction to Solid State Chemistry

[Course Home](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-091-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2018/)

Textbook: 
- [General Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications-v1.0/index.html)

I couldn't do a lot of the assigned problems because there were no solution sets to check answers.
Additionally, the textbook was not consitent on providing answers to odd-numbered questions.
So, I did what I could, I'll probably have to revisit things in the future if I want a better understanding.

There was no textbook content for amorphous solids (glasses) or polymers.
So, those sections were skipped over...they should be covered in a materials science course.
