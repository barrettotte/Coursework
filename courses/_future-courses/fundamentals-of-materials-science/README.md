## Course Completion

TODO:

## Textbook

I think the original course has a physical chemistry textbook listed as well.
I will omit this since I will have taken [MIT 5.61 Physical Chemistry I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-61-physical-chemistry-fall-2017)
beforehand.

[Introduction to Materials Science for Engineers](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780136012603)
