# Coursework

Coursework for various courses from [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

My notes are taken in a separate repository with other topics (currently private).


## Purpose
Going through these courses is just my way of trying to become more familiar with things outside of programming. 
In no way am I a master of anything in these courses or even close to it. 

If I learn a handful of things by the end of a course, then I accomplished my goal.
I just really enjoy learning new things.


## Coursework
For each section/chapter of each course I did the following:
- Read (preferred) or watch lectures
- Read suggested or other relevant textbook
- Complete some exercises. Either:
  - Some of the instructor's suggested exercises or homework (only if they show expected final answer).
  - Some exercises that seemed to demonstrate new concepts that were introduced in the section.
- Complete exams if genuinely interested, reasonable size, and solutions included.

While it would be cool to sit down and take years to rigorously go through everything A-Z, its just not practical.
Depending on what the assignments were, I would cut them short as it made sense to do so.


## Homebrew Degrees
When I say "homebrew degree" I just mean a list of courses that make sense to take together.
By no means do I think these are equivalent to an actual degree.

| Title                                                           | Course Count |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [Mechanical Engineering](disciplines/mechanical_engineering.md) | 32 |

## Books
A really basic list of cheap used books I bought to supplement courses.
Generally I tried not spend over twenty dollars per book.
