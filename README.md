# Coursework

Coursework for self-studying mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science.

My notes are taken in a separate repository with other subjects (currently private).

## Purpose

Going through these courses is just my way of trying to become more familiar with things outside of the world of programming. 
In no way am I a master of anything in these courses or even close to it. 

If I learn a handful of things by the end of a course, then I accomplished my goal.
I just really enjoy learning new things.

Ultimately, I'd love to be familiar with a little bit of everything from each discipline.

## Coursework

Instead of just reading an entire textbook cover to cover, I try to find an MIT OCW
course corresponding to the material covered in each textbook. Then, I use the MIT OCW syllabus
as a foundation to make my own shorter/dumb course on the material.

For each chapter of a textbook:

- read and take high-level notes
- complete odd-numbered exercises using notes as reference

While it would be cool/impressive to sit down and take years to rigorously go through everything A-Z, its just not practical.
As long as I can learn some material and work through a few practice problems for each concept, then I'm satisfied.

## Disciplines

Courses split by discipline, kind of like a "homebrew" degree plan.

These are loosely based on some University of Maryland and MIT undergraduate degree plans.
Its worth noting that there are duplicate entries between plans since some disciplines share courses.
