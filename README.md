# Coursework

Coursework for various courses from [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/) and self-studying textbooks.

My notes are taken in a separate repository with other topics (currently private).

## Purpose

Going through these courses is just my way of trying to become more familiar with things outside of the world of programming. 
In no way am I a master of anything in these courses or even close to it. 

If I learn a handful of things by the end of a course, then I accomplished my goal.
I just really enjoy learning new things.

Ultimately, I'd love to be familiar with a little bit of everything from each discipline.

## Coursework

For each section/chapter of each course I did the following:
- Read (preferred) or watch lectures
- Read suggested or other relevant textbook
- Complete some exercises. Either:
  - Some of the instructor's suggested exercises or homework (only if they show expected final answer).
  - Some exercises that seemed to demonstrate new concepts that were introduced in the section.

Sometimes courses wouldn't have any solutions to check my assignments against. So, the course would pretty much
just be a guide to what I was supposed to learn from the assigned textbook. I would just use the textbook's
odd-numbered answers to check my work.
Sometimes an assigned textbook was way too expensive. So I'd pick another somewhat equivalent
book to go through instead.

While it would be cool/impressive to sit down and take years to rigorously go through everything A-Z, its just not practical.
As long as I can learn some material and work through a few practice problems for each concept, then I'm satisfied.

## Disciplines

Courses split by discipline, kind of like a "homebrew" degree plan.
There are duplicate entries between plans since some disciplines share courses.

| Title | Course Count |
| ---- | ---- |
| Computer Science | TODO |
| Electrical Engineering | TODO |
| [Mechanical Engineering](disciplines/mechanical_engineering.md) | 30 |

## Books

A really basic list of cheap used books I bought on Amazon or ebay to supplement courses.
Generally I tried not spend over twenty dollars per book (this was not always possible though).
