# Homebrew Mechanical Engineering Degree Coursework

Coursework for my "homebrew mechanical engineering degree" based on degrees from [MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/mechanical-engineering-course-2/) and [UMD](https://eng.umd.edu/sites/clark.umd.edu/files/enme-4yrplan-ge-2016-2017.pdf)

I also added a few extra engineering electives for some other topics I was interested in.

**I want to keep a pragmatic approach to this. I'm a programmer, not an engineer.**
