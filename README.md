# Homebrew Mechanical Engineering Degree Coursework

Coursework for my "homebrew mechanical engineering degree" using [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

My notes are taken in a separate repository with other topics (currently private).
Eventually I might make this a general "homebrew degree" repository as I get more interests.


## Coursework
For each section/chapter of each course I did the following:
- Read (preferred) or watch lectures
- Read suggested or other relevant textbook
- Complete some exercises. Either:
  - Some of the instructor's suggested exercises or homework (only if they show expected final answer).
  - Some exercises that seemed to demonstrate new concepts that were introduced in the section.
- Complete any reasonably sized assessment (project, assessment, etc.)


While it would be cool to sit down and take year(s) to rigorously go through everything A-Z, its just not practical.
Depending on what the assignments were, I would cut them short as it made sense to me.

I'm a code monkey that wanted to learn about mechanical engineering in a structured way.
There's a whole lot out there I want to learn about and not nearly enough time to do it.

## TODO
Separate so I can see what order to take courses
