# Homebrew Mechanical Engineering Degree Coursework

Coursework for my "homebrew mechanical engineering degree" based on degrees from [MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/mechanical-engineering-course-2/) and [UMD](https://eng.umd.edu/sites/clark.umd.edu/files/enme-4yrplan-ge-2016-2017.pdf).

I also added a few extra engineering electives for some other topics I was interested in.


## Coursework
For each section/chapter of each course I did the following:
- Read (preferred) or watch lectures
- Read suggested or other relevant textbook
- Complete some exercises. Either:
  - Some of the instructor's suggested exercises or homework.
  - Some exercises that seemed to demonstrate new concepts that were introduced in the section.
- Complete any reasonably sized assessment (project, assessment, etc.)


While it would be cool to sit down and take year(s) to rigorously go through everything A-Z, its just not practical.
Depending on what the assignments were, I would cut them short as it made sense to me.

I'm a code monkey that wanted to learn about mechanical engineering in a structured way.
There's a whole lot out there I want to learn about and not nearly enough time to do it.
