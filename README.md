# Homebrew-Degrees

Coursework for my "homebrew degree(s)" using [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

My notes are taken in a separate repository with other topics (currently private).


## Coursework
For each section/chapter of each course I did the following:
- Read (preferred) or watch lectures
- Read suggested or other relevant textbook
- Complete some exercises. Either:
  - Some of the instructor's suggested exercises or homework (only if they show expected final answer).
  - Some exercises that seemed to demonstrate new concepts that were introduced in the section.
- Complete any reasonably sized assessment (project, assessment, etc.)


While it would be cool to sit down and take year(s) to rigorously go through everything A-Z, its just not practical.
Depending on what the assignments were, I would cut them short as it made sense to me.

I'm a code monkey that wanted to branch out and learn new disciplines in a structured way.
There's a whole lot out there I want to learn about and not nearly enough time to do it.


## Homebrew Degrees
When I say "homebrew degree" I just mean a list of courses that make sense to take together.

## Books
A really basic list of cheap used books I bought to supplement courses.
Generally I tried not spend over twenty dollars per book.
