# Coursework

Coursework for various courses from [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

My notes are taken in a separate repository with other topics (currently private).


## Purpose
Going through these courses is just my way of trying to become more familiar with things outside of programming. 
In no way am I a master of anything in these courses or even close to it. 

If I learn a handful of things by the end of a course, then I accomplished my goal.
I just really enjoy learning new things.


## Coursework
For each section/chapter of each course I did the following:
- Read (preferred) or watch lectures
- Read suggested or other relevant textbook
- Complete some exercises. Either:
  - Some of the instructor's suggested exercises or homework (only if they show expected final answer).
  - Some exercises that seemed to demonstrate new concepts that were introduced in the section.

Sometimes courses wouldn't have any solutions to check my assignments against. So, the course would pretty much
just be a guide to what I was supposed to learn from the assigned textbook. I would just use the textbook's
odd-numbered answers to check my work.

While it would be cool to sit down and take years to rigorously go through everything A-Z, its just not practical.
There's a fine line between being pragmatic and having an illusion of competence with what I'm learning.
I'm sure that some courses I stayed on the illusion side and some I remained pragmatic.
On top of learning new material I am also still learning how to learn properly.


## Homebrew Degrees
When I say "homebrew degree" I just mean a list of courses that make sense to take together.
By no means do I think these are equivalent to an actual degree.

| Title                                                           | Course Count |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [Mechanical Engineering](disciplines/mechanical_engineering.md) | 30 |

## Books
A really basic list of cheap used books I bought to supplement courses.
Generally I tried not spend over twenty dollars per book.
